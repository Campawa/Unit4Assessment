I got to part 2 and 3 and was getting stuck trying to figure out how to parse the Json array into a recycler view and combine them together. I think if I could have figured that out I'd be able to figure how to make an intent for each object within the recycler view to show a new Book in the top fragment. But yeah it was a little hard to wrap my brain around how to do it. 
I feel like I know how to create fragments and recycler views but not together or combine certain topics together. It jumbles me up a little bit. 
I definitely needed more help in being able to pair stuff up together.
